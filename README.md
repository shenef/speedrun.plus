# speedrun.plus

## About 
speedrun.plus is an in-development browser extension that aims to improve the user interface, 
experience, and maybe even performance of [speedrun.com][1]. The plan is to support Chromium and 
Firefox-based browsers as well as Safari. If you are interested in contributing to the project, 
you can join our [Discord Server][2] where we discuss things.

## Installation
Since the extension is not yet available in a browser extension store you have to do some manual 
steps to install speedrun.plus. Download the extension files by clicking [here][3] and extract the 
zip. Then proceed with the steps below.

### Chrome: 
Open `chrome://extensions/` (menu button > More tools > Extensions), enable the Developer mode > 
"Load unpacked" > open the folder that was contained in the zip you just downloaded > click 
"Select Folder" 

### Firefox:
Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` (Settings > Extensions & Themes > click the cog in 
the top right of the page > Debug Add-ons), click on "Load Temporary Add-on..." and open the 
manifest.json file in the folder you just extracted the downloaded files to.  
Unfortunately, you will have to repeat those steps every time you launch Firefox.
